# Overview

Howdy! This is an excersize in JavaScript I made to help familiarize myself with the language. I was origonally going to use the walmart API, but it proved to difficult for my purposes. I learned how to manipulate the DOM from JS and how to recursively call functions to operate a binary tree. It wasn't entirely neccesary at this scale, but great practice for the future!

# Development Environment

No librarys were used beyond those included, but I did use ES6 modules to make a more realistic API experince with my homemade attempt!
