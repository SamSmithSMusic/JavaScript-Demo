# Overview

Howdy! This is an exercise in JavaScript I made to help familiarize myself with the language. I was originally going to use the Walmart API, but it proved too difficult for my purposes. I learned how to manipulate the DOM from JS and how to recursively call functions to operate a binary tree. It wasn't entirely necessary at this scale, but great practice for the future!

# Development Environment

No libraries were used beyond those included, but I did use ES6 modules to make a more realistic API experience with my homemade attempt!
